;;; Commentary:

;; "Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a flexible, powerful, server-side
;; application for playing music." <https://www.musicpd.org/>.
;; `elmpd' is a tight, ergonomic, asynchronous MPD client library in
;; Emacs Lisp.

;; See also `libmpdel' <https://gitea.petton.fr/mpdel/libmpdel>,
;; `libmpdee' <https://github.com/andyetitmoves/libmpdee> and the
;; `mpc' package which ships with Emacs beginning with version 23.2.

;; Create an MPD connection by calling `elmpd-connect'; this will
;; return an `elmpd-connection' instance immediately.  Asynchronously,
;; it will be parsing the MPD greeting message, perhaps sending an
;; initial password, and if so requested, sending the "idle" command.

;; There are two idioms I've seen in MPD client libraries for sending
;; commands while receiving notifications of server-side changes:

;;     1. just maintain two connections (e.g. mpdfav
;;        <https://github.com/vincent-petithory/mpdfav>); issue the
;;        "idle" command on one, send commands on the other

;;     2. use one connection, issue the "idle" command, and when asked
;;        to issue another command, send "noidle", issue the
;;        requested command, collect the response, and then send
;;        "idle" again (e.g. `libmpdel').  Note that this is not a
;;        race condition per
;;        https://www.musicpd.org/doc/html/protocol.html#idle -- any
;;        server-side changes that took place while processing the
;;        command will be saved & returned on "idle"

;; Since `elmpd' is a library, I do not make that choice here, but
;; rather support both styles.

;; The implementation is callback-based; each connection comes at the
;; cost of a single socket plus whatever memory is needed to do the
;; text processing in handling command responses.  In particular, I
;; declined to use `tq' despite the natural fit because I didn't want
;; to use a buffer for each connection, as well.

;; Application-layer connections to MPD need to be "built-up" beyond
;; the initial socket connection:

;;     1. the MPD greeting sent in response to the initial connection
;;        needs to be parsed (`elmpd-connection' makes the protocol
;;        version therein available)

;;     2. if the caller supplied an initial password, the "password"
;;        command must be sent and the response processed

;;     3. if the caller requested that the connection "idle", the
;;        "idle" command must be sent

;; Only then is the connection ready for commands.

;; Construct instances with `elmpd-connect'-- when that returns the
;; connection is in the process of being built-up asynchronously, but
;; you can still issue commands on it; they'll just get queued up &
;; sent as soon as possible. The point is, the ctor won't block.

;; Type invariants:

;;     1. prior to being ready to handle commands, `init' shall be
;;        nil; once ready `init' shall be t

;;     2. post-init, "idling" connections are handled differently than
;;        "regular" connections:

;;        a. idling connections will either:

;;           i. have an empty queue and be listening for notifications
;;              (i.e. have issued the "idle" command)

;;           ii. have a non-empty queue, have issued the command at
;;               the head of their queue, and be waiting for a response

;;        b. regular connections will either:

;;           i. have an empty queue and have no command outstanding

;;           ii. have a non-empty queue, have issued the command at
;;               the head of their queue, and be waiting for a response

;; Open questions:

;;     1. what if the server (for whatever reason) closes the
;;        connection underneath us?
;;        - do we offer a "keepalive" option, say send a "ping"
;;          command once every n seconds, just to keep the
;;          connection open?

;;     2. tear-down: if the connection object it GC'd, we'll close the
;;        socket & delete the process, but what if the user
;;        issues a "close"?  Do we want to offer an explicit dtor of
;;        some kind?

          :name The name by which to refer to the underlying
                socket (AKA network process); it will be modified
                as necessary to make it unique; defaults to
                \"*elmpd-connection*\"

          :host The host on which the MPD server resides;
                defaults first to the environment variable
                \"MPD_HOST\", then to \"localhost\"

          :port The port on which MPD is listening; defaults
                first to the environment variable \"MPD_PORT\",
                then to 6600

         :local Path to the Unix socket on which MPD is
                listening; mutually exclusive with :host & :port;
                this option is preferred, so to force a TCP
                connection, pass this explicitly as nil

      :password If given, the \"password\" command shall be
                issued after the initial connection is made; this
                should only be done over an encrypted connection,
                such as port forwarding over SSH

    :subsystems If given, this connection will perpetually idle;
                whenever a command is issued on this connection,
                a \"noidle\" command shall be given, followed by
                the command.  When that command completes,
                \"idle\" will be re-issued.  This argument shall
                be a cons cell whose car is either the keyword
                'all, the symbol representing the subsystem of
                interest, or a list of symbols naming the
                subsystems of interest (e.g. '(player mixer
                output) and whose cdr is a callback to be invoked
                when any of those subsystems change; the callback
                shall take two parameters the first of which will
                be the `elmpd-connection' which saw the state
                change & the second of which will be either a
                single symbol or a list of symbols naming the
                changed subsystems

The connection object will still be in the process of
construction on return; we need to collect the greeting & parse
the protocol version, we may need to send the \"password\"
command & we may need to send the \"idle\" command, if requested.
This is all handled asynchronously; the caller is free to send
commands through the connection & they will be queued up & sent
as soon as possible."
